# Week 1 of my 15Challenge

## This is my first week of the "15Challenge" where I build 15 rails apps in 15 weeks.

I built build a link aggregator web-app, similar to Reddit or Hacker News.

* Users using this application will be able to upload links and submit them for other users.  
* Only users who upload links can edit and delete them.
* Other users can leave comments and either upvote or downvote a link.

## Gems installed:

* Simple form
* Bootstrap-Sass
* Jquery-Rails
* Devise
* Acts as Votable
* Will Paginate
